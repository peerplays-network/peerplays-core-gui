# Wallet

As you may have noticed already, this application is a web application and runs
in a browser. A connection is established to a trusted node in the network that
serves as a gateway to the rest of the ecosystem.

## Wallet Security

Rest assured that our servers do never have access to your funds because none of
your private keys ever leave your browser. Instead they are encrypted with your
pass phrase and are stored in your local browser's database. Hence you should
make sure to have a proper [Backup](../introduction/backups.md) to not lose
access to your funds on computer malfunctions or browser crashes.

## Wallet Management

Furthermore, the user interface is capable of carrying and accessing several
separated wallets each containing possible several accounts and corresponding
funds. You can add, backup, and switch existing wallets in `Settings->Wallets`.
