# Backups

It is recommended to make regular backups of your wallet even though in most
cases a single backup may be sufficient. Please note that in order to recover
from a backup you will also need to provide the pass phrase because **backups
are encrypted**. Hence, if you either lose your wallet or your pass phrase you
will be unable to access any of your funds again!

Backups can be obtain from the Wallet Management Console (`Settings ->
Wallets`).

## Wallet Exports

The most convenient way to create a new backup is by exporting the wallet with
the provided link in the Wallet Management Console. Please store your backups
safe from loss, theft, and natural catastrophes 

## Brainkey (advanced users ONLY)

If you never manually imported an account key into your wallet, you can
alternatively backup your accounts and their funds by exporting the *brainkey*,
a string of words from which your keys are derived deterministically.

## Remark: Hierarchical Authorities (advanced uses ONLY)

If you are using hierarchical authorities (account and/or active permissions),
backing up your keys alone may not be sufficient to regain access to your funds!
Please revise the documentations about hierarchical authorities.
