### Voting

Voting in Bitshares is important for both the security and the development of the network. If you prefer, you may delegate your voting power to a Proxy, who can then vote on your behalf. If you do choose to use a Proxy, manual voting will be disabled.

Voting changes will only be applied once you click on 'Publish changes' and broadcast your changes to the network.
