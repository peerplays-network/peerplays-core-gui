[# permissions]
Permissions define the available features for an asset. However, even if a feature is permitted, it must still be activated using the corresponding flag in order to be enforced by the blockchain.

After creation, you may only remove a given permission, you cannot enable a permission that was disabled on creation.

[# flags]
Flags define which asset features are active or inactive. They can be switched on and off by the asset owner at any time.
