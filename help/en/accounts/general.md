# Accounts

As you may have already noticed by now, this blockchain technology requires you
to register an account name. This comes with many advantages: Besides improved
scalability, we have separated the identity from the transaction authorizing
signature. In practice, *owning an account name* is independent from being able
to *spend its funds*. Furthermore, both rights (we call them *permissions*) can
split among an arbitrary complex relation of people (we call them *authorities*)
using *weights* and a required *thresholds*.
